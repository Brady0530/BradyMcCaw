about_me = "My name is Brady McCaw. I am currently a 3rd year at Georgia Tech studying Industrial Engineering! Originally from the coastal town of Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, I don't know what the hell I am going to do after I graduate. I currently work for a firm out of Sandy Springs where hopefully I make a lot of money. Reid Evans is mad about me but he shoved me so he's never going to get his $20 back. Lately I've been on a house music and iced coffee kick - I've spent more time in Cat Island Coffeehouse than my own home but that's ok because I've been productive. "
